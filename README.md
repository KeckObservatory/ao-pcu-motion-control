# ao-pcu-motion-control

This repository is for the development of the PCU subsystem in the Keck 1 and 2 AO systems.   

It is forked from the Berkeley GJCompSci/pcu_api source, but will not be pushed back; at the conclusion of the collaboration with external contributors, it will be relocated to internal Kevk SVN at $KROOT/src/kss/ao/pcu, then this repo will sunset.
